# Regina Haley – Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Regina and I am a self-driven professional transitioning into the field of data analytics. What began as a curiosity has grown into a real passion and purpose. This portfolio showcases hands on projects I’ve completed to demonstrate core competencies in SQL, Excel and Python and each aligned with real-world business analysis needs.

My goal: to land a data analyst apprenticeship or junior role where I can continue building skills through applied work, mentorship and collaborative problem-solving.

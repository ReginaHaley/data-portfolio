# Regina Haley – Data Analytics and Software Development Portfolio. I’m learning both, with analytics as my foundation and software dev as my expansion and AI Software Engineer as my long term goal. 

Welcome! I'm Regina and I am a self-driven professional transitioning into the field of data analytics and software dev. What began as a curiosity has grown into a real passion and purpose. This portfolio showcases hands on projects I’ve completed to demonstrate core competencies in SQL, Excel and Python as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript, each aligned with real-world business needs.

My goal: to land anapprenticeship or junior role where I can continue building skills through applied work, mentorship and collaborative problem-solving while working on my AAS for AI Software Engineering.
